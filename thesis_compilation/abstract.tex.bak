\emph{The radio resources become more and more expensive nowadays. The requirements for the transmission systems become more and more demanding. The necessary transmission rate also become more and more high. This demand increase complexity for a designed systems. \\
Generalized frequency division modulation is the new approach to increase spectral efficiency in comparison to the modern OFDM scheme.  GFDM uses time mixing for the symbols in one transmission block to increase density of the transmitted data. The new approach is flexible and can adjust a frequency overlap with one variable. The frequency overlap slightly increase the SER of the system, but decrease out-of-band radiation. The system also can adjust the number of turned on subcarriers in case if frequency sharing used. The system can wok in the same frequency bands as ther legal users and doesn't interfere with them. The transmission system become complex in the symbol estimation, but introduce the self-interference between symbols.\\
GFDM modulation can be explained with the PARATUCK2 tensor model to present modulation scheme in more efficient and natural way. This model explain the transmitted data as the slice-wise product between three different matrices and two tensors. This notation allow to introduce time and frequency domain separately for the symbols in one transmission block. The PARATUCK2 model can be exploited to find more efficient ways to estimate unknown symbols or update channel variables}
